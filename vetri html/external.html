    <p>Atoms of radioactive elements can split. <u>According to Albert Einstein,</u> mass and <i>energy are interchangeable</i> under certain <b>circumstances. When atoms split,</b> the process is called nuclear fission. In this case, a small amount of mass is converted into energy. Thus the energy released cannot do much damage. However, several subatomic particles called neutrons are also emitted during this process. Each neutron will hit a radioactive element releasing more neutrons in the process. This causes a chain reaction and creates a large amount of energy. This energy is converted into heat which expands uncontrollably causing an explosion. Hence, atoms do not literally explode. They generate energy that can cause explosions.</p>

    <p>Since March 8, 1990, Womenâ€™s <a href="https://www.pexels.com/" target="blank">Day has been</a> observed by SAARC (South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation) comprising seven countries namely India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Maldives. The day is celebrated to highlight the problems of the girl child in these countries. It is very sad that girl children are subjected to extreme neglect and disrespect, especially in underdeveloped countries. The birth of a girl child is seen by parents as a cause of pity. They are deprived of proper nutrition, education, economic opportunities and social status or respect. We must eliminate these prejudices and provide a bright future for girls by educating them.</p>
